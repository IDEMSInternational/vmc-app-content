But there are three left over, so the number of cards must be in the sequence …, 39, 43, 47, 51.\nFor dealing among three people with two left over we get the sequence …, 41,44,47,50\nFor dealing among five people with two left over we get the sequence …,32, 37,42,47\nThe number that appears on all three lists is 47.\nWe could also solve the puzzle starting with the last two clues.
