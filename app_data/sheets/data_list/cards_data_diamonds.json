On the second day, you only have 4 paths left to choose from because you can’t take the one you took on Monday. On the third day you have 3 to choose from and so on. The solution is therefore 5×4×3×2×1 =120. This is counting how many ways you can order 5 objects (paths) in 5 positions (days of the week). This is a problem on permutations (without repetition). \nThe mathematical symbol ! is called factorial and represents multiplying by decreasing integers until you reach 1. So 5×4×3×2×1 can be written as 5!",

The solution is obtained as 6×5×4×3×2×1 = 120  Notice this is 6×120 (6 times the previous solution). You have just discovered a recursive property of factorials: n! = n×(n - 1)!.",
      "extension_1_answer": "What if you had to go to school on Sundays as well and you also found four new paths so there are now 10 paths to choose from? In how many ways can you arrange your week such that every day you go to school walking on different paths?",

The solution is obtained by counting how many ways you can order 10 objects (paths) in 7 positions (days of the week). The solution is obtained by 10×9×8×7×6×5×4 =  604800. If you wanted to calculate this using factorials, 10! is close to the answer, but we don’t want 3×2×1 at the end. 3×2×1 is 3! so we can do 10! ∕ 3! =604800.",
